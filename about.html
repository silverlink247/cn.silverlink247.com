        <p>
            Caduceus Intelligence Corporation (CIC) is a spin-off company of the University of Arizona (UA). CIC is
            affiliated with the UA’s Artificial Intelligence Laboratory. CIC has extensive research and development
            partnerships with several prestigious institutes in Taiwan, China and Denmark for its flagship products
            DiabeticLink and SilverLink. CIC has received STTR Phase I funding from the National Science Foundation for
            its smart health projects (Award ID: 1417181). Our company is also the recipient of seed funding from the
            National Taiwan University in Taiwan and University of Southern Denmark in Denmark.

            We successfully launched our first health IT product DiabeticLink in Sept. 2014. DiabeticLink is a diabetes
            patient disease management portal featured for health tracking, drug safety, health information resources
            and community social networking. CIC’s current work is focused on developing a smart and connected home
            health monitoring system for senior care called SilverLink.
