            <h3>Staying connected with your loved ones</h3>

            <p>Once the system has been set up, you can stay updated on your loved one’s the daily activities by using
                the SilverLink User Dashboard and setting up your notification preferences so that SilverLink can send
                you an alert when something isn’t right. Your notification settings will permit the system to warn you
                only when your predefined condition is met. For example, “No activity in AM”- based on this setting,
                SilverLink will only send you an alert when there is no activity detected on the sensors from 12 am to
                12 pm. You can also select who will be notified. One can also connect with your family member via
                SilverMail, a feature that allows you to share videos and photos online.</p>
