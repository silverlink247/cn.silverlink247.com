            <h3>Staying connected with your loved ones</h3>

            <p>Once the system has been set up, you can stay updated on your loved one’s the daily activities by using
                the SilverLink User Dashboard and setting up your notification preferences so that SilverLink can send
                you an alert when something isn’t right.

                We understand the importance of communication and so our SilverMail feature is designed to let you
                connect with your friends and family by sharing videos and photos online.
            </p>
